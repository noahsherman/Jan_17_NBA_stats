# Jan_17_NBA_stats
First try at NBA python work

Don't know how to pull data from NBA.com or basketball-reference.com yet so I manually copied relevant data from bref...


Iterate through lines in Python_NBA_Test.txt to grab relevant stats: Name, Pts, TRB, AST

If player had triple double or double double, stat line will display.
